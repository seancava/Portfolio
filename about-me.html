       <h1>About Sean Cavanaugh</h1>
       <p><img src="images/p10.png" alt="A Picture Of Sean Cavanaugh" width="222" height="294">
       I was born in a small town in Northern Ontario. 
       My parents didn't have much but we made do and were happy. 
       When my parents finished school my father landed his first 
       job with the Texaco Corporation. We moved South and continued 
       on as a happy family. When I was 5 years old I started a long 
       career in public school. Mostly the days were drudgery with 
       occassional relief of socializing with my peers. Later when I 
       entered highschool I was able to taylor my studies to suit my 
       intrests. Ater highschool I persued post secondary education 
       at various schools studying various forms of visual art and 
       design. After graduating with a diploma I set out to begin 
       a career in graphic design. I worked here and there for 
       some years before starting my own graphic design freelancing business.
